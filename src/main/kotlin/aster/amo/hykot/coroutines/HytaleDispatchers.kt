/**
 * Provides coroutine dispatchers tailored for Hytale server operations.
 *
 * Use these dispatchers to ensure coroutines run on the appropriate threads:
 * - [Main] for operations requiring the main server thread
 * - [Async] for background operations that don't need the main thread
 * - [IO] for I/O-bound operations like file or network access
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```kotlin
 * launch(HytaleDispatchers.Async) {
 *     val data = loadDataFromDatabase()
 *     withContext(HytaleDispatchers.Main) {
 *         applyDataToWorld(data)
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
